Quick hack to convert vine movies into animiated gif's. I had this running
here: https://twitter.com/vine2gif 

I should note that the settings I chose during the conversion process was to
make sure I kept the gif under 2MB for easy upload to imgur. 

Also, I've hardcoded paths and usernames so you'll want to change them too.

Requires envoy, requests and tweepy.
